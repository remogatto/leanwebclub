# Monster Game - Keeping Score

In today’s project, we’re going to convert our Monster Shuffle project
into a game.

Instead of displaying the monsters outright, they’ll all be hidden
behind doors. Clicking on one will reveal the monster. If you find the
sock before you’ve found all of the monsters, you lose.

If the user finds the sock before they’ve found all of the monsters,
display a message letting them know they lost. If they find all of the
monsters, display a message letting them know they’ve won. Either way,
show a button that they can click to play again.
