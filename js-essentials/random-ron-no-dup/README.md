# Random Ron

A site that displays a random Ron Swanson quote (from the show Parks
and Recreation) using the [Ron Swanson Quotes
API](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes). Note that
if the same quote gets returned from the API in the last 50 quotes,
the app skip it and fetch another one instead.
